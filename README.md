# GenAI Playbook

A structured knowledge base and engineering reference for building production-ready Generative AI systems using:

- OpenAI Platform (LLMs, Embeddings, Responses API)
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Node.js ecosystem

This repository contains:
- Core GenAI concepts
- Architecture patterns (RAG, Agents, Memory, Tooling)
- Best practices
- Production checklists
- Reusable Node.js code examples
- Experiments and mini-projects

---

## Philosophy

This repo is structured by **concept and system maturity**, not by framework.

The goal:
- Understand fundamentals
- Design robust AI systems
- Build production-grade agents
- Apply scalable patterns

---

## Stack

- Node.js (ESM)
- OpenAI SDK
- Agents SDK
- MCP-compatible tooling
- Vector DB (pluggable)
